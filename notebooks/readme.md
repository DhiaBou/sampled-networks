### swim_to_sampled_testing

this notebook tests whether a sampled network trained from a swim network give the exact same weights and biases.

### 2D_visualisation

visualizes the differences in weights and biases of a network trained with adam or swim and a sampled network. Also visualizes the weights and x_1, x_2 pairs during training of a network with adam every d_epochs epochs

### adam_to_samped

visualization and comparison between different strategies of choosing x_1 x_2 pairs, and updating the layer 2 weights and biases.
